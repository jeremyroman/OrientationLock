OrientationLock
===============

A simple Android application which allows toggling the orientation lock setting from the notification area.

Requires Ice Cream Sandwich (Android 4.0, API level 14) or above, mostly to avoid having to handle a number of legacy cases.

I wrote this as a quick project to review the Android application structure, including services, broadcast
receivers and content observers. It has the side benefit of being useful to me as Android apparently doesn't
present this option in an easy-to-access place (like the two-finger-swipe options panel) on my Nexus 4.
